            <h2>About Gendry</h2>
            <p>
               <strong>Gendry</strong> is a skilled blacksmith and an unacknowledged bastard son of <strong>King Robert Baratheon</strong>. After escaping the massacre of Robert's other bastards in King's Landing, Gendry is slated to join the <strong> Night's Watch</strong> before being captured and traded multiple times-first to <strong> Tywin Lannister</strong> at Harrenhal, then to the <strong> Brotherhood Without Banners</strong>, and finally to <strong> Stannis Baratheon</strong> on Dragonstone. After escaping from Dragonstone with the help of <strong> Ser Davos Seaworth</strong>, Gendry returns to King's Landing and remains in hiding until Davos returns for him. He later accompanies <strong> Jon Snow</strong> north of the Wall on a mission to capture a wight to use as a bargaining chip at the Dragonpit Summit, before joining the ranks of <strong> Targaryen's army</strong> at Winterfell.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the death of King Robert, the massacre of his other bastards, the deaths of Robert's brothers Renly and Stannis, as well as Stannis's daughter Shireen, Gendry is the last known living person of House Baratheon's bloodline.
